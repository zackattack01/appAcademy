On Wednesday he ate through three plums, but he was still hungry.
He stayed inside for more than two weeks.
One lollipop,
On Saturday he ate through  one piece of chocolate cake,
He became a beautiful butterfly!
The next day was Sunday again.
On Friday he ate through five oranges, but he was still hungry.
Called a cocoon,
One slice of Swiss cheese,
and POP, out of the egg came a tiny, very hungry caterpillar.
In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf.
On Monday he ate through one apple.  But he was still hungry.
The caterpillar ate through one nice leaf, and after that he felt better.
One ice-cream cone,
That night he had a stomach ache!
One piece of cherry pie,
One Sunday morning the warm sun cam up...
Now he wasn't hungry anymore--and he wasn't a little caterpillar anymore.
On Thursday he ate through four strawberries, but he was still hungry.
He started looking for some food.
Then he nibbled a hole in the cocoon, pushed his way out and...
One slice of salami,
Around himself.
One sausage,
He was a big fat caterpillar.
And one slice of watermelon.
One pickle,
He built a small house,
One cupcake,
On Tuesday he ate through two pears, but he was still hungry.
